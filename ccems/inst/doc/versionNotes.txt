Version 1.0 Initial release 3/5/2009

Version 1.01 3/13/09 Fixed help pages to avoid overhang in automatically generated pdf manual. 
                     Upgraded codes to handle enzyme activity data. Broke mkGrids up into smaller functions.
                     Added TK1 example to ccems-package help page as a laptop example. 
                    
Version 1.02 3/20/09 A major bug in mkKd2Kj was fixed (factors were reciprocals of what they should be!). 

                     A new papers/BMCsysBio08 directory was added to include 
                     actively maintained derivatives of the original script Rt.r.

                     hubchar is no longer an option of mkg and is instead now always the first char of 
                     first name in strct, which should always be the root (i.e. free hub) name. 
                     
                     bug that kIC must be different from IC has been fixed
                     
                     a weights column is now allowed in the data dataframe. The weights are divided
                     by their means before entering the SSE to minimize their effect on SSE and AIC.
                     Since the weights multiply the residuals before their inner product is made to form 
                     SSE, the weights should be reciprocal std dev (not variances). In TK1.r v data 
                     with v<Vmax/2 is weighted more heavily than data with v>Vmax/2, i.e. 2 variance bins are used. 
                     
Version 1.03         4/9/09  New bug in mkSpurs found and fixed (by adding maxnKjPs=maxTotalPs if g$activity is false).
                     Increased default topN to 10 and increased it to maxTotalPs+1 if it is
                     less than or equal to it. This avoids errors if the user sets maxTotalPs>=topN.
                     Removed normalization on residuals. Added g field option for box-cox with lambda = 0.5 for k data. 
                     5/1/09 Added minTotalPs option to ems, mkSpurs and mkGrids
                     5/11/09 moved transformation and monomer mass into mkModels and ems, since it is data oriented
                     and also gave options to types of transformations.
                     5/13/09 changed IC to KIC to gain clear symmetry with kIC
                     5/20/09 fixed p to go as e^c/(1+e^c) and back as c= log(p/(1-p)). Let monomer mass be estimated.
                     6/1/09 added opts to force a mass or p estimate (i.e. to shrink space in these cases). Replaced
                     pRows logical outside mkSpurs and mkGrids with p to allow passes of initial values and to 
                     gain symmetry with m1 parameter (negative is fixed, positive is estimated, value is initial or fixed
                     value). 
                     6/7/09  Added multivariate proportions (mass distributions) as an output type. Modified mkg to make
                     c code where all non-hub reactants are free concentrations (e.g. in SEC). 
                     7/20/09 removed prints in mkSpurs and lowered maxTotalPs default to 2.
                     
                        
Version 1.04         7/23/09  New bug in mkSpurs found and fixed (by adding maxnKjPs=maxTotalPs if g$activity is false).
                     7/27/09  Added TK2 datasets to package
                     8/4/09   fixed mkHTML to show SSE again
                     12/28/09 Added Barroso 2003 and 2005 to TK2 dataset
                     1/13/2010 uploaded to incoming
