<h2>Make Grid Model Space</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This function takes <code>g</code> from <code>mkg</code> and maps it into a 
dataframe of grid model definitions. It also augments and returns the input list <code>g</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre> mkGrids (g,maxTotalPs=NULL,minTotalPs=NULL,contig=TRUE,
                atLeastOne=TRUE,atLeastOneOfEach=FALSE, 
                KIC=1,kIC=1,fullGrid=FALSE,
                m1=-90,p=-1,forceM1=FALSE,forceP=FALSE) </pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>g</code></td>
<td>
The output of <code>mkg</code>. </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>maxTotalPs</code></td>
<td>
The maximum number of parameters of models in the model space. 
If <code>NULL</code> all models are found (but see <code>fullGrid</code> below). </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>minTotalPs</code></td>
<td>
The minimum number of parameters of models in the model space.
If <code>NULL</code> no minimum is imposed. </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>contig</code></td>
<td>
Set to <code>TRUE</code> to allow Kd equalities of threads only in contiguous runs. Tentatively, 
this should always be <code>TRUE</code>.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>atLeastOne</code></td>
<td>
Leave <code>TRUE</code> if only models with at least one complex of maximal size are 
to be considered. Set <code>FALSE</code> if there is no
prior knowledge supportive of the assertion that the largest oligomer must be in the model.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>atLeastOneOfEach</code></td>
<td>
Set <code>TRUE</code> if only models with at least one complex 
of each oligomer size are to be considered. This is useful when the data are multivariate
proportions (i.e. mass distribution data) and each j-mer is clearly present. </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>KIC</code></td>
<td>
The initial condition of all K parameters optimized. The default is <code>IC=1</code> (in uM). </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>kIC</code></td>
<td>
The initial condition of all k parameters optimized. The default is <code>kIC=1</code> (in 1/seconds per occupied active site). </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>fullGrid</code></td>
<td>
Set <code>TRUE</code> if a full binary K model is wanted, else grids that are 
equivalent to spurs are eliminated from the model space. 
This is used to obtain grid reparameterizations of full spur models to 
form model averages across common binary K parameters.  </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>m1</code></td>
<td>
The hub protein's monomer mass in kDa. 
The default is 90 for the big (R1) subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR).
This only matters if the data is mass data. Negative numbers imply fixed values and
positive numbers imply starting values to be fitted to the data.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>p</code></td>
<td>
Probability that hub can oligomerize, i.e. is not damaged. 
Set to a positive value if additional rows are to be added to the output dataframe to include models 
with <code>p</code> freely estimated. Set negative to hold fixed. Value is the initial or fixed value.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>forceM1</code></td>
<td>
Set <code>TRUE</code> to force all models to estimate M1, i.e. to not generate models with M1 fixed. </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>forceP</code></td>
<td>
Set <code>TRUE</code> to force all models to estimate p, i.e. to not generate models with fixed p. </td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
In a run of equal threads, the first head node of the run is the leader (optimized parameter) and the remaining nodes in the run are followers 
(i.e. constrained to track the leader in parameter estimate optimizations); 
a default in <code>ems</code> is that only leader estimates are reported in html
in the <code>results</code> subdirectory.
In contrast to its counterpart <code><a href="mkSpurs.html">mkSpurs</a></code>, a means of traversing
the grid model space incrementally with increasing numbers of parameters remains to be 
found and implemented, i.e. 
<code>mkGrids</code> does not have <code>state</code> inputs and outputs and the whole space is found in one batch.  
When this drawback 
limits research due to too much memory usage, 
attempts will be made to identify an approach that, similar to what has been implemented for 
<code>mkSpurs</code>, specifies
chunks of grid models, fits them, and then specifies the next chunk 
based on knowledge of where the previous chunk stopped. 
Note that setting 
<code>maxTotalPs</code> to smaller values will not help this foreseen memory problem 
as the entire grid model space dataframe is first generated 
and then, only later, truncated to <code>maxTotalPs</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
A list with components 
</p>
<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>chunk</code></td>
<td>
The entire K equality model space requested by the arguments. 
In this dataframe each row specifies a model. If the <code>activity</code> field of <code>g</code> is <code>TRUE</code> 
this dataframe includes k columns. The row names encode the equality constraints. 
Therein . separates K models from k models, I stands for infinity, 
J stands for freely estimated (in spur components), and other letters are the same when 
parameters that correspond to their positions equal each other.
Unmatched other letters are freely estimated and thus just like J's but in
k and binary K components of the model names. 
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Keqs</code></td>
<td>
A list of K equality constraints indexed by 
model names where each element is a vector of character strings whose names are followers and
values are leaders. </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>keqs</code></td>
<td>
Similar to <code>Keqs</code> but for activity constraints. This is <code>NULL</code> if 
<code>activity</code> in <code>g</code> is <code>FALSE</code>. </td></tr>
